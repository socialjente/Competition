        <p>Management had deemed it 'okay' for me to be alone in the office. This all but guaranteed one thing: shenanigans! Honestly guys, what were y'all thinking! It has been through sheer grit and superhuman professionalism that I've been able to suppressed my urges for so long. But break I would, and break I did. Luckily for y'all, the 'serious fun' was non-invasive.</p>
        <p><b>The shenanigans</b>: I have held a formal competition in which I reviewed all your workstations. I reviewed 1) Your desks. 2) Your chairs. And 3) how you set up your chairs. I can hear y'all thinking.. "But Jente -the righteous- Kramer, how did you ensure objectivity?". One word: I used ChatGTP to score each review on a scale from 1 to 10.</p>
        <p><b class="underlineRed">Important!</b> All images of a workstations are clickable. Clicking those will reveal all the juicy details about that workstation^^</p>
        <p>To see the results of the competition, go the the 'Results' page.</p>

        <button><a href="/results" class="inline-flex button">Results</a></button>

        <p class="text-sm">*By having clicked "Continue to the website" on the previous page, you have retroactively agreed to have your chair participate is the competition. Thanks ;)</p>
